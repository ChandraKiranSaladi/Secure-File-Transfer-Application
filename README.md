## Secure File Transfer Application

Design and implemention of a secure Internet file transfer application/protocol. The program will include several security requirements as outlined below. 

### Supported Functionality 
*	Client should be able to upload files to the server in a secure fashion. Client also downloads files from server in a secure fashion. 
*	When the file is uploaded or downloaded, it should be intact, i.e. it should retain its features. For instance, if it is executable, it should be able to run, or if it is an image, the image must be same as the original file. 
*	Client only needs to authenticate the server. The server need not authenticate client. 
*	The only technology that is allowed for securing communication is keyed hash, e.g. SHA-256. 

### Security Requirements 

The application will include the following security requirements: 
1.	**Authentication**: Client authenticates the server using serverâ€™s RSA public key. 
2.	**Confidentiality**: The messages exchanged between client and server will be protected from exposure to others that are not authorized to read what is being communicated. The only security primitive that is available to build a confidential communication mechanism is a keyed hash, e.g. SHA-256. Part of the project is designing a communication protocol that is secure against well-known attacks on confidentiality. 
3.	**Integrity**: The possible message alteration in transit should not go undetected by the communicating parties. Again, you can only use a keyed hash mechanism to achieve this.
